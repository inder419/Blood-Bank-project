	  <h3>#List of Cons of Donating Blood</h3>
	  <h4>1. Can Be Painful</h4>
	  <p>The moment you decide to donate blood, you will certainly feel the needle to 
		puncture into your veins. So while some people find this as a discomfort, others 
		actually fear the sight of needles. In fact, others fear the sight of blood.</p>
	  <h4>2. Causes Weakness</h4>
	  <p>After blood donation, a person can feel dizzy or may faint. 
		These are just common symptoms after giving out some amount of blood.

	  <h4>3. Increases the Paperwork</h4>
	  <p>People donate blood for certain reasons, particularly when a patient require so after a 
		surgical operation. For this reason, parents or close relatives of patients will be the ones who 
		will donate blood in order to prevent anonymous donors. Nevertheless, anonymous or otherwise,
		they will still undergo strict screenings to identify safer blood transfusion. 
		But, relatives may be required to process more paperwork than those who do it anonymously.</p>
