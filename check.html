		<h1 >Who Can Donate Blood?</h1>
		<p class="lead">Most people can donate blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one&nbsp; need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.&nbsp; Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:</p>
		<h2 >Age</h2><p>You are aged between 18 and 65.</p>
		<ul><li>In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.</li>
		  <li>In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Weight</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>Your weight should be at least 45-50 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% blood.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Health&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>
		<p>You must be in good health at the time you donate.</p>
		<p>You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.</p>
		<p>If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.&nbsp; If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.</p>
		<p>If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.</p>
		<p>You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Travel</h2>
		<p>Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral.</p>
		<p>Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.</p>
		<h2>Behaviours</h2>
		<p>You must not donate blood:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months</li>
		  <li>Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently:&nbsp;</li>
		  <li>Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)</li>
		  <li>Have ever injected recreational drugs.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different countries.</p>
		<h2>Pregnancy and breastfeeding</h2>
		<p>Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.</p>
		<p>It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).</p>
		<h2>More information on eligibility to donate</h2>
		<p>National&nbsp; eligibility guidelines must be followed when people donate blood in the blood service in specific countries.&nbsp; To find out whether any health conditions, medications, professions or travel history to could affect your ability to give blood, please search for detailed information in the national/local blood services.</p>
